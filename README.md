For this project I used OpenAI API key - 3.5 Turbo. 
## Description
The program is very simple. It has one drop-down box where users can pick action.<br>
There are 2 boxes. One is for user input, other for response.<br>
In the example below, I pasted text from article about AI and requested to get only key elements.

## Technial Description
I used Spring Boot in order to make a website. For 3.5 GPT model to work it needs model and messages from users. This can be find in Message.java, Choice.java and GPTRequest.java. These classes are DTOs. <br>
<br>

Response.java is list of choices generated by model, this is what users see. <br>
<br>
I do have one RestController with /ask endpoint, this is where all the logic for model is happening.
